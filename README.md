# The Game 
There's a snake in my boot! üêç <br>
Originally made for Nokia phones in 1998, Snake has been re-made for all kinds of devices. Here's my version, using Turtle.py<br>
The objective of this game is simple, try to catch the Apples (AKA dots) on screen, without hitting the wall or yourself, as you get bigger.

### Version 2.0 change log
```
üîß UPDATE - Leveling
Now, as your score increases, the game speed also increases.

üí° NEW! - High score system
It's possible now to save your score on your computer. You can also try to beat your friends' record.
```


## Snake

Move the Snake body by pressing "Up", "Down", "Left" and "Right" arrows in your keyboard.


## Apples

Apples are generalized randomly on screen. As you eat them, the snake gets bigger.  


## Leveling  & Game over

When you eat apples and get bigger, the game gets harder, as the chance to step on your body improves. Also, the game speed increases.

When the snake collides with one of the walls, or with its own body, it's game over and everything stops.

## NEW! - High Scores

Now, on the top of the screen, it shows your current run score and your high score.

When the player beat a high score, at the end of the game, a screen will pop-up asking the player's name. It will be recorded on the high score players list.

The game-over screen also has changes. It shows the list of top 10 high-scoring players, ordered by score.
