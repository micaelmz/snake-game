# The Game 
There's a snake in my boot! üêç <br>
Originally made for Nokia phones in 1998, Snake has been re-made for all kind of devices, here's my version, using Turtle.py<br>
The objective is simple, try to catch the Apples (AKA dots) on screen, without hitting the wall or yourself, as you get bigger.

## Snake

Move the Snake body pressing "Up", "Down", "Left" and "Right" arrows in your keyboard.

## Apples

Apples are generalized randomly on screen, as you eat them, the Snake gets bigger.


## Leveling  & Game over

When you eat apples and get bigger, the game gets harder, as the chance to step on your body improves.

When the snake collides with one of the walls, or with its own body, it's game over and everything stops.
